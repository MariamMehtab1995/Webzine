    <h1>The Psychological Game of Chess</h1>
    <p>Chess is as much mental as tactical:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Intuition:</b> Experienced players often “feel” the right move without calculating every step.</li>
        <li><b>Focus:</b> Staying calm under pressure is key to winning tense games.</li>
        <li><b>Mental mistakes:</b> Even champions blunder when distracted or tired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Managing emotions and mindset can change the outcome of tough matches.</p>
