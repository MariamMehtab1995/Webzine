<body>
    <h1>The Legendary Origins of Chess</h1>
    <p>Chess was invented in ancient India, around the 6th century.</p>
    <p>The early game was called <em>Chaturanga</em>, meaning "four limbs" of an army:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infantry (Pawn)</li>
        <li>Cavalry (Knight)</li>
        <li>Elephants (Bishop)</li>
        <li>Chariots (Rook)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From India, it spread to Persia, where it became known as <b>Shatranj</b>. The words <i>“Check”</i> and <i>“Checkmate”</i> come from Persian phrases <em>Shah</em> (king) and <em>Shah Mat</em> (king defeated).</p>
    <p>By the 15th century, chess rules evolved into the modern game during its journey to Europe.</p>
