    <ul>
        <li><b>Fork:</b> One piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at once.</li>
        <li><b>Pin:</b> Attacking a piece so moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it.</li>
        <li><b>Skewer:</b> Like a pin but attacking the more valuable piece first.</li>
        <li><b>Discovered Attack:</b> Moving one piece reveals an attack from another piece.</li>
    </ul>
